# Death Star Assault
 Project carried out as a practice with the Unity engine, inspired by the Star Wars saga and totally programmed by me. The graphic assets (3D models and Skybox) and the music are not my property.

It has been done using Unity version 2019.4.18f1.

The playable game can be downloaded from https://sergiomejias.itch.io/death-star-assault
